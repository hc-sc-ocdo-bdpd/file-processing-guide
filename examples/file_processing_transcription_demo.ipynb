    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this demo, we used the `file-processing-transcription` library as a plugin to add transcription capabilities to `file-processing`. By wrapping `File` objects with `TranscriptionDecorator`, we can transcribe audio and video files, with the transcribed text and language accessible in the `metadata` dictionary. This plugin approach allows seamless addition of transcription functionality for supported file types."
